# Damask-React
A rewrite of an HR/Payroll Web Application originally made with Andrew Markland &amp; Kevin Dillman.

If you're looking for a template to start your own in-house payroll/HR application, try this one out! It uses MSSQL and .NET, and can be set up to run on some very cost-effective cloud solutions for your small business needs. More and more features will be added in time, this is still VERY EARLY in dev.
